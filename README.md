This [project](https://johnpaulinepineda.github.io/Portfolio_Project_49/) manually implements the Stochastic Gradient Descent Optimization, Adaptive Moment Estimation Optimization, Adaptive Gradient Optimization, AdaDelta Optimization, Layer-wise Optimized Non-convex Optimization and Root Mean Square Propagation Optimization algorithms with fixed values applied for the learning rate and iteration count parameters to optimally update the gradients and weights of an artificial neural network classification model. The cost function and classification accuracy optimization profiles of the different algorithms were evaluated and compared.
